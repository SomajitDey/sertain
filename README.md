# SERTAIN - SERver ToolchAIN

This is just a childish project. The **sertain.bash** file contains some shell-functions, combining which, one can easily construct a basic http/1.1 server. All one needs are `ncat` and `jq`. No need to know NodeJS, Golang or anything of that sort, just simple bash scripting.

For example, see the shell-scripts-- **simplest-server-demo**, **stream-server-demo** and **silo-server-demo**

Also see the command-line http-request-header-parser [httparse](https://github.com/SomajitDey/httparse).
